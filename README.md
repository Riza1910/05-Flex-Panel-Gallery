# Flex Panel Gallery

This is the fifth project of the Javascript30 challenge.

This JavaScript mini-project, "Flex Panels ðŸ’ª," showcases the power of flexbox CSS properties in creating interactive panel layouts. By toggling classes on click events and reacting to transition end events, the panels expand and contract, offering a visually engaging user experience.


## Concepts utilised in making the project -

1) DOM Selection:

Using document.querySelectorAll() to select multiple elements based on a CSS selector.

2) Event Handling:

Adding event listeners to elements using addEventListener().
Handling click events (click) and transition end events (transitionend).

3) Class Manipulation:

Toggling classes on elements using classList.toggle() to apply or remove styles dynamically.

4) Conditional Logic:

Checking conditions using if statements.
Using includes() to check if a string contains another string.

5) Iterating Over NodeLists:

Iterating over NodeLists using forEach() to apply event listeners to each element.
